    "echo" : "The bot will echo back whatever the user says to.\n\nIf a channel is mentioned inside of what the bot is told to echo, it will attempt to post the message there, instead of in the same channel that the command was called from. \nIf a channel mention is detected, the bot will cut off the first word of the echo string.\nThis is to make it so you can have the first word as the place to be posted to, but keep in mind that *ALL* channel mentions are detected.\n\nUsage :: echo Hello World\n      :: echo #general Hello World\n      :: echo #general Check out #bot-testing",
    "invite" : "Calling this will make the bot print out the invite command, so you can add it to your own server.\nAll of the permissions needed for the bot are included in the invite link.\n\nUsage :: invite",
    "purge" : "This will remove the last x messages from the channel, with x being the number you input. \nThe number has no limit, so be careful with how much you delete.\nThis command will only run if the user calling it has manage messages, or administrator.\n\nUsage :: purge 50",
    "rename" : "This will change the name of the bot to whatever is put after the command call.\nIf no name is given, then the bot will remove any nickname that it has.\nThis command will only run is the user calling it has manage nicknames, or administrator.\n\nUsage :: rename Apple.py\n      :: rename",
    "uptime" : "This will show the current uptime of the bot, along with some other stats about its running.\n'Uptime' references the time since the bot's last restart, so if the bot was recently restarted, despite no lapse in bot activity, the timer will count from its last time coming online.\n\nUsage :: uptime",
    "ccolour" : "This will change the colour of the calling user.\nThe colour changed to is given by the user in the form of a hex code, and is done via roles.\nIn short, the bot checks if there is a role with the user's name and discriminator. If there is, the bot changes the colour of that role.\nIf there isn't, the bot creates one, assigns it to the user, tries to move it as far up as it can, and changes its colour.\n\nUsage :: ccolour #FFFFFF\n      :: ccolor FFFFFF"
